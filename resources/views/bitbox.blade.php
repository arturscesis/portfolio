            <br> It was a massive challenge for me, because for the first time i got to experience <span class="text-fuchsia-600 font-bold">how everything REALLY works in production</span>, how to create a product that is usefull for others not just me.
            <br> Also i learned how to integrate <span class="text-fuchsia-600 font-bold">E-Signature</span>, how to properly work with API's.
            <br> React was a huge challenge for me, because it was new to me.
